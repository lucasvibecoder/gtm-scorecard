  ⚡ 3 WATCH AREAS

  1. Ops Hire Timing: 7/10
     Ramp's RevOps function exists and appears stable — but no new ops
     roles are posted despite aggressive AE/SDR expansion into enterprise.
     When you double the sales floor without scaling the ops layer
     underneath, the ratio slips quietly. By the time you feel it, your
     SDRs have already built workarounds nobody documented.

  2. Data Hygiene: 7/10
     SDR JDs mention "maintain accurate and detailed activity, notes, and
     pipeline data in Salesforce." That's normal at this scale, not a red
     flag — but it's worth watching. The line between "SDRs log their
     own activity" (healthy) and "SDRs are doing data entry ops should
     own" (unhealthy) gets blurry fast when you're scaling inbound and
     outbound simultaneously.

  3. Automation Maturity: 7/10
     Segment detected on their marketing site. Salesforce + Salesloft
     confirmed in JDs. But no visible automation layer (Workato, Tray)
     connecting the stack. At Ramp's scale they likely have internal
     engineering building integrations — but if the GTM team can't
     self-serve data flows without filing eng tickets, that's a
     bottleneck waiting to happen.

  ─── FULL DIAGNOSTIC ───

  Overall: 8/10 🟢

  1. Sales/Ops Ratio       🟢 8/10  RevOps + enablement roles exist alongside sales hiring. Ratio is healthy.
  2. Enrichment Maturity   🟢 8/10  ZoomInfo confirmed via JD requirements. Likely Clearbit or similar given the scale.
  3. Outbound Infra        🟢 9/10  Salesloft confirmed in SDR JD. Salesforce as CRM. Full outbound stack in place.
  4. Data Hygiene          🟢 7/10  Salesforce + ops team = likely maintained. SDR JDs include CRM logging but within normal bounds.
  5. Automation Maturity   🟢 7/10  Segment present. No visible workflow automation layer, but internal eng likely handles this.
  6. Role Scope Creep      🟢 9/10  SDR JDs are clean — prospecting, qualifying, booking. No infrastructure work assigned to sellers.
  7. Ops Hire Timing       🟢 7/10  Ops team exists but no new ops postings. Stable or slightly behind the growth curve.

  ─── DIAGNOSIS ───

  Ramp is what "good" looks like. They have a mature GTM stack
  (Salesforce + Salesloft + ZoomInfo), dedicated RevOps and enablement
  functions, and clean role separation in their JDs. SDRs prospect
  and book — they don't build process or manage tools. The only
  question mark is whether their ops scaling keeps pace with what
  appears to be an aggressive enterprise push. At $1B+ ARR and 45,000+
  customers, the sheer volume of data flowing through their systems
  means even small infrastructure gaps compound fast.

  ─── PRIORITY FIXES ───

  1) Monitor ops-to-sales ratio quarterly — stable ops team + growing sales team = slowly degrading ratio
  2) Evaluate dedicated GTM engineer for enrichment pipeline optimization as enterprise motion scales
  3) Consider intent data layer (6sense/Bombora) if not already in place for enterprise targeting

  ─── EVIDENCE ───

  • Salesforce confirmed: SDR JD lists Salesforce proficiency as requirement
  • Salesloft confirmed: SDR JD references Salesloft as engagement platform
  • SDR JD is structured and polished — "Conduct consultative discovery conversations,"
    "multi-threading into high-value inbound accounts" — this is a mature sales org writing
  • Multiple SDR types (Inbound SDR, Outbound SDR) = differentiated motion, not "one SDR does everything"
  • Investors: Sequoia, Founders Fund, Thrive, Goldman Sachs — tier-1 backing
  • 45,000+ customers, $1B+ ARR — infrastructure at this scale is a feature, not a luxury

  WHY THIS SCORECARD MATTERS EVEN FOR A HEALTHY COMPANY:

  Most diagnostic tools only work when something is broken.
  The real test is whether the framework can distinguish between
  "healthy and scaling well" vs "healthy but about to hit a wall."

  Ramp is the former. The scorecard confirms it with evidence,
  not assumptions. That's what makes it credible when you
  hand someone a scorecard that says 4/10 — they know the
  framework also produces 8/10 when it's deserved.
