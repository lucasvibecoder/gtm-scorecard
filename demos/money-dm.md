# Money DM — Warmly (4/10 Scorecard)

## Target: VP Sales or Head of Growth at Warmly
## Channel: LinkedIn DM

---

Hey [Name] — this isn't a pitch, just something I noticed that
I think is worth 2 minutes of your time.

I built a 7-dimension GTM health diagnostic from my time as
a GTM Engineer at Clay. Ran Warmly through it. You scored
7/10 on enrichment — which makes sense, you literally are one.
But you scored 2/10 on sales/ops ratio: 6 revenue roles open,
zero ops or enablement.

The part that stood out: your SDR JDs list CRM management and
process documentation as core responsibilities. That's ops work
sitting inside a seller's job description. From building GTM
infrastructure at Clay, I can tell you that pattern usually means
SDRs are spending 30-40% of their time on non-selling work —
and you start losing them within 2 quarters.

Happy to send you the full scorecard if it's useful. I also
happen to build the exact infrastructure that fixes this
(enrichment pipelines, CRM automation, outbound ops).

Either way — cool product. Figured the diagnostic might be
worth seeing.

## Why this DM converts:

**Line 1** — disarms immediately. "Not a pitch" + "2 minutes."

**Line 2** — establishes credibility (Clay, GTM Engineer, built
a diagnostic framework). Not "I'm a consultant looking for work."

**Line 3** — the irony hook. An enrichment company with a 2/10
ops ratio. This is memorable. They'll screenshot this internally.

**Line 4** — the specific, verifiable observation. "Your SDR JDs
list CRM management and process documentation." They can go check
this right now. It's not an assumption — it's a fact from their
own job posting.

**Line 5** — connects observation to consequence using YOUR
experience. "From building GTM infrastructure at Clay" — not
generic advice, specific pattern recognition.

**Line 6** — offers value first (the scorecard), then credentials
second (I build the fix). The scorecard is the trojan horse.

**Line 7** — low-pressure close. "Either way" gives them an
out. Reduces sales resistance.

## Adapt for different channels:

### LinkedIn DM (shorter):
Hey [Name] — ran Warmly through a GTM health diagnostic I built
from my Clay GTME experience. You scored 7/10 on enrichment
(makes sense) but 2/10 on ops ratio — 6 revenue roles, zero ops.
Your SDR JDs include CRM admin as a core duty. That pattern
usually breaks within 2 quarters. Happy to share the full scorecard.

### Cold email:
Subject: Your SDRs are doing ops work (I can see it from your JDs)

[Same body as LinkedIn DM but with a more specific CTA]

Would a 15-min walkthrough of the full scorecard be useful?
I built the enrichment and routing automation that fixes
exactly this at Clay — happy to show you what I'd prioritize
for Warmly specifically.

### Warm intro request:
Hey [mutual connection] — I built a GTM diagnostic tool and
Warmly flagged as having some infrastructure gaps I know how to
fix. Would you be comfortable making an intro to [Name]? I'd
lead with the diagnostic as value, not a pitch.
